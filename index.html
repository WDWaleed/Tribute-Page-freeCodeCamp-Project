          Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a main combatant
          of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the
          Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and is publicly
          recognized as the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D.
          Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of Luffy's
          crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the
          grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew
          of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki
          Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. As
          a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created
          during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of
          the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy
          and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to
          become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a
          promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former
          bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody
          Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy to be included among the
          eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red
          Line with bounties of over Berry - 100,000,000 shortly before the
          Summit War. He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach
          would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Zoro gained his first bounty of Berry - 60,000,000 after the Arabasta
          Arc. It later increased to Berry - 120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby
          incident, then again to Berry - 320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc.
          Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Berry -
          1,111,000,000.
